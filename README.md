# Lilith Archotech Stuff

This is a private Mod for RimWorld 1.3 that patches some Archotech related things I don't like in mods I use in my playthrough.

  - [Vanilla Cooking Expanded](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2134308519) **(required)**

## Changes

- *More Archotech Garbage* - Changes the colour of the Archotech lamp to yellow. In my head-canon Archotech stuff always glows yellow.
- *More Archotech Garbage* - Compressing Archotech Foodstuffs now grants Cooking XP.
- *Vanilla Cooking Expanded* - Adds the large cooking stove from vanilla cooking expanded to the list of linkable buildings for the Archotech cooking assistant.
